# Homework 3 - Pandas to Pyspark
Convert Jupyter notebook written in Pandas to Pyspark.

## What did I accomplish?
I completed this assignment by converting Pandas Commands to Python.
I had to skip some of the visualizations, but I did my best with using
the Pyspark count method which returns a histogram in the form of a
dataframe.
