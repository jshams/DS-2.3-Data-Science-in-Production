### Homework 1 - Deploy Model to AWS
Deploy API with model to AWS with Docker and AWS Beanstalk.

## What did I accomplish?
I had many Tensorflow errors to begin with, but I decided to create a function that predicts
randomly (no model) just to get it deployed. Then I ran into Docker issues. But I tried to
fix that by assuming it worked locally and pushing, but when I pushed to AWS my build failed
every time. This project was a painful experience because I've been having bad devops issues.
I asked Vincenzo for help, and not even he could figure out the errors.
